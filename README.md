# Marvel Top-Five XMEN Villians - Website
This is my first website using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap as my css framework. I created five webpages that show a image, comic book, biography and video
about a specific villian you are looking at. I also created a moblie version and added page responsiveness to the website as well.

# Purpose - :black_nib:
I have always enjoyed the Xmen series and the villians that were introduced to me when reading and watching the show. So, I decided to create this website
dedicated to the top 5 Xmen villians of all time in the comics.
